# Advent of Code 2022

This repository contains my solutions to [Advent of Code 2022][aoc22].

I'm solving the problems with Rust. I've tried to keep things clean, though I'm not shying away from the more cursed stuff (day 1 uses assembly; how worse could it get).

As usual, these done are to my best knowledge at the time of writing, but you shouldn't consider anything here as objectively correct before checking.
